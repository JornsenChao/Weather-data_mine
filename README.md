# Urban Heat Island Effect
The urban heat island effect is a phenomenon where urban areas, where structures such as buildings and roads are highly concentrated, experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. The Urban Heat Island Effect Project, leveraging machine learning algorithms, aims to accurately predict temperature variations within urban environments based on location and physical characteristics of the area, with a particular focus on building height and terrain.
