Case 1: Architect
Hans is an architect. Hans wants to know whether the building they want to build will affect the air quality/temperature in the local area. He also want to access the current temperature/air quality of where they are trying to build. Hans wants an interface that will allow bidirectional information exchange based on either the building design or the desired weather conditions. Hans will not have programming skills, but will be able to understand basic engineering concepts.

Case 2: Scientific Advisor for Policymakers
Carol is a scientific advisor for policy makers, with a background in environmental engineering background. They need to share the impact of different building designs on the local weather to push environmentally friendly policy, and advise whether certain building permits are environmentally friendly.
