For ONE purpose (decision) of our project, evaluate 3 different packages that can help.
Maybe we can do it for visualization? idk what we want to do.

Need 1-2 minutes of background.

A good (active) package on github has multiple forked and stars
Has good open:closed issues ratio
Should have a good README, explaining documentation + installation guide

Should have slides!
