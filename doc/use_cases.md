Case 1: Architect
* Select building location and view regional building height.
    * User clicks location
    * System provides coordinates. Computes regional building heights. Returns average building height.
* View average temperature within a season/date of interest or average yearly temperature. (1)
    * User selects whether they want info about yearly or seasonal temperatures.
    * System computes average temperatures, using ML model. Displays the average temperature.
* View changing temperature dependent on building height (2)
    * User inputs several building height options.
    * System computes expected temperatures as before, displays the data in a graph.

Case 2: Advisor
* Select building location, local buildings average height
* View expected temperature change
* View graph/raw data between building heights and local temperatures (1)

Case 3: New move
* Select multiple building locations
* Identify the average annual local temperatures in each location (simultaneously displayed for comparison)


Notes:
(1) This is not completed; to be done in a later version.
(2) Currently displays the expected annual temperature based on the current building conditions.
